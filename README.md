## 🧩 How to Use in OBS with Rumble Studio

1. In Rumble Studio:
   - Go to your **Chat Widget**, **Viewer Widget**, or **Pinned Comment Widget**
   - Copy the URL

2. In OBS:
   - Add a **Browser Source**
   - Use the Rumble Studio Widget URL
   - Set a custom resolution (e.g. 400x800 for chat)
   - Make sure **"Custom CSS"** is checked (you’re styling via the Rumble widget)

## ⚠️ Notes

- These CSS files are tested for **dark OBS overlays**. If using light themes, consider adjusting font color.
- You can combine multiple styles into one file if using a unified widget.
- Works best when Rumble Studio widgets are embedded using **OBS Browser Source**.
